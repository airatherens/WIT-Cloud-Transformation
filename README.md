# WIT-Cloud-Transformation

Western Institute of Technology (WIT) – Hybrid Cloud Simulation Project for our Cloud Computing course (CPSY-304). We designed, deployed, and cost-estimated a hybrid Azure cloud environment to modernize WIT’s IT infrastructure, focusing on security, fault tolerance, and seamless student/staff access.

---

## 📖 Overview

Team project for CPSY-304 (Amrit, Aira, Dylan).  
The goal was to simulate a hybrid cloud migration for **Western Institute of Technology (WIT)**, which currently operates an aging Calgary datacenter and minimal branch-site servers in Edmonton and Lethbridge.

**Objectives:**
- Reduce costs and eliminate branch servers.
- Modernize authentication & identity (Entra ID).
- Implement hybrid services: file shares, web apps, containerized apps.
- Enforce Canadian compliance (PBMM).
- Provide secure connectivity, monitoring, and disaster recovery.
- Enable global student registration.
- Test features within a capped $5,000 monthly budget.

## 🏗️ Cloud Architecture

### Departments & Resource Groups
Each WIT department received its own **Azure Resource Group (RG)** with tagging for billing:

- **RG-Admin** → Admin Services (file shares, archives)  
- **RG-Academic** → Academic Services (websites, AKS, video storage)  
- **RG-IT** → IT Department (monitoring, backups, replication, device mgmt)  
- **RG-SchoolOfIT** → Instructor VM templates  
- **RG-Facilities, RG-Business, RG-Health, RG-Hospitality** → Staff device management  
- **RG-ITTesting** → Testing/dev area ($5k cap)  

**Tagging Schema:**
- Department: IT | Academic | Admin  
- Owner: user@wit.edu  
- Environment: Production  
- Purpose: FileShare | WebApp  

### Network & Connectivity
- **VPN Gateway** in Calgary datacenter  
- **Local Gateways** for Edmonton & Lethbridge  
- **Site-to-Site VPN** (CGY-EDM, CGY-LETH)  
- Optional **Hub-Spoke** model for future expansion

## 🔐 Identity & Security

- **Entra ID tenant** for all departments
- **RBAC:**
  - IT Managers = Owner  
  - IT Supervisors = Contributor  
  - IT Techs = Reader  
  - Instructors = VM Contributor  
- MFA enforced for all users  
- Canada region only deployment  
- Mandatory tagging policy  
- Encryption at rest enforced  
- Legacy SKUs blocked  

**Compliance:** 5 PBMM policies implemented  
**Backup & DR:** Recovery Services Vault + Geo-replication (Calgary → US region)  
**Monitoring:** Alerts on CPU, Log Analytics workspace linked to VMs  

---

## 💰 Costing & Budgets

- **Test/Dev budget** capped at **$5,000/month**  
- Each department billed separately using tags  
- Estimated monthly costs included: storage tiering, App Services, AKS cluster usage, and VPN bandwidth
