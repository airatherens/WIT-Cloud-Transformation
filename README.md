# WIT-Cloud-Transformation

Western Institute of Technology (WIT) ‚Äì Hybrid Cloud Simulation Project for our Cloud Computing course (CPSY-304). We designed, deployed, and cost-estimated a hybrid Azure cloud environment to modernize WIT‚Äôs IT infrastructure, focusing on security, fault tolerance, and seamless student/staff access.

---

## üìñ Overview

Team project for CPSY-304 (Amrit, Aira, Dylan).  
The goal was to simulate a hybrid cloud migration for **Western Institute of Technology (WIT)**, which currently operates an aging Calgary datacenter and minimal branch-site servers in Edmonton and Lethbridge.

**Objectives:**
- Reduce costs and eliminate branch servers.
- Modernize authentication & identity (Entra ID).
- Implement hybrid services: file shares, web apps, containerized apps.
- Enforce Canadian compliance (PBMM).
- Provide secure connectivity, monitoring, and disaster recovery.
- Enable global student registration.
- Test features within a capped $5,000 monthly budget.

## üèóÔ∏è Cloud Architecture

### Departments & Resource Groups
Each WIT department received its own **Azure Resource Group (RG)** with tagging for billing:

- **RG-Admin** ‚Üí Admin Services (file shares, archives)  
- **RG-Academic** ‚Üí Academic Services (websites, AKS, video storage)  
- **RG-IT** ‚Üí IT Department (monitoring, backups, replication, device mgmt)  
- **RG-SchoolOfIT** ‚Üí Instructor VM templates  
- **RG-Facilities, RG-Business, RG-Health, RG-Hospitality** ‚Üí Staff device management  
- **RG-ITTesting** ‚Üí Testing/dev area ($5k cap)  

**Tagging Schema:**
- Department: IT | Academic | Admin  
- Owner: user@wit.edu  
- Environment: Production  
- Purpose: FileShare | WebApp  

### Network & Connectivity
- **VPN Gateway** in Calgary datacenter  
- **Local Gateways** for Edmonton & Lethbridge  
- **Site-to-Site VPN** (CGY-EDM, CGY-LETH)  
- Optional **Hub-Spoke** model for future expansion

- Legacy SKUs blocked  

**Compliance:** 5 PBMM policies implemented  
**Backup & DR:** Recovery Services Vault + Geo-replication (Calgary ‚Üí US region)  
**Monitoring:** Alerts on CPU, Log Analytics workspace linked to VMs  

---

## üí∞ Costing & Budgets

- **Test/Dev budget** capped at **$5,000/month**  
- Each department billed separately using tags  
- Estimated monthly costs included: storage tiering, App Services, AKS cluster usage, and VPN bandwidth
